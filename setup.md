# Installation

Because R and RStudio work together, you need to install them both. The steps in this section should guide you through the process. Once installed, you will be working with RStudio and R will be running in the background. 

## How to Install R?

Installing R in 4 easy steps

<br>

**Step 1.** 

a. Go to: https://www.r-project.org/

b. Click on **CRAN** or **download R**.

<br>

*Note:* You'll only do this once, although, eventually you'll have to update to the most recent version. Follow the same procedure as today.

**Step 2.** Select a mirror

A *Mirror* is a server somewhere in the world with a copy of the program. Choose the mirror closest to you. For example, if you are in the UK, you can select the one from University of Bristol. Don't worry too much about this.

<br>

**Step 3.** Select the download appropriate for your computer (Microsoft, Mac or Linux)

<br>

**Step 4.** Open the program you downloaded and follow the instructions

*Note* - There is another tutorial identical to this one that shows the process you need to follow if you have a mac.
