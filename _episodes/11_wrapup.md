## Acknowledgements

We hope you enjoyed this workshop. It is delivered as part of an ongoing initiative to provide training for staff and students to expand their skillsets and position themselves to confidently perform the informatics elements of their research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. We are grateful to the workshop leaders and helpers for supporting the delivery.

We invite you to complete our [feedback survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=d10qkZj77k6vMhM02PBKU6c8tNVRoxhAjFFJWmm07JtUQkpUUlkxMkQwTjg0TjhZNU42OTRFNzFWNi4u) this helps us ensure our courses are fit for purpose and valuable, and highlight areas where we may need to expand provision. 

If you have benefited in any way from this course and want to support it's long term sustainablity then please recommend it to your colleagues, and enthuse about it to your senior leadership team. 

## Next steps

The course notes are designed to provide support year round to those unable to attend a scheduled workshop and are available for you to revisit and share as you need.

Our intention is to expand the provision of intermediate workshops that will be a natural progression from this one. You may also be interested in workshops we provide in other languages to compliment the skills you have learnt here. Details of all our [available workshops can be found here](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/workshop-homepage/workshops.html).
