## Introduction to the programme

This workshop, and the others in the series, were put together by the Research Software Engineering Group supported by researchers from across the University. This is as part of an ongoing initiative to provide training for staff and students to expand their skillsets and position themselves to confidently perform the informatics elements of their research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution, and we are grateful for your feedback which is a core component of this process. 


## Our aims

Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and virtual. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, there are helpers in the room so raise your hand if you need assistance. There is also a dedicated helper for the virtual participants so please raise your virtual hand to attract their attention. 

We would like to highlight our code of conduct - essentially be respectful and aware that we all have different backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints.
  
Let's get started.
