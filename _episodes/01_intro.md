## Welcome

Welcome to **R: from Beginner to Intermediate**. Our aim is to provide you with a comprehensive overview of the R programming language assuming no prior knowledge of R or programming. While the commands may be specific to R, many of the concepts are also applicable to other programming languages. Over the course of these three sessions you will gain many transferable skills and knowledge that will establish the foundations of a programmer.

## Introduction to Coding For Reproducible Research

This workshop is offered as part of the [Coding For Reproducible Research Intiative](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/workshop-homepage/). 
Our ambition is to offer a recurring annual series of workshops open to all staff and students, with opportunities for novices through to more experienced users, to expand their skillsets and position them to confidently perform their research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. A key objective is that the framework we put in place ensures that the workshops delivered are fit for purpose, of a consistent high standard, that delivery is sustainable in the longer term, minimises the workload burden on those who facilitate them and can adapt and expand as new training needs are identified.

Championed by and in partnership with

- Research Software Engineering group
- Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI)
- Researcher Development (Doctoral College and ECRs)
- Reproducibility Network Institutional Leadership team
- Quantitative Health Network (QHN) 
- EPSRC Hub for Quantitative Modelling in Healthcare
- Translational Research Exchange @ Exeter (TREE)

This workshop, and the others in the series, were put together by a series of working groups formed by researchers from across the University supported by Exeter's Research Software Engineering Group. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution. We appreciate your patience as we develop and test these materials and are grateful for your feedback which is a core component of this process. We also need to maintain accurate records of how many participants we have reached, so ask you to mark you attendence on the google spreadsheet.

## Workshop format

We are all here because we are passionate about sharing our knowledge and supporting the development of our colleagues. For most of us, this is not a requirement of our current position and we are doing this at the margins of our time.

As this is a beginner's workshop, we will be doing live demonstrations where we encourage you to type along with us - this is called live coding. We will pause for a break every 60-90 minutes, but there will also be periods in-between demonstrations where you are free to take additional comfort breaks if required.  This is a hybrid workshop, please be aware of this, online participants we find that engagement is higher if you are willing to turn your cameras on. There will be a dedicated helper for online participants please, either raise your hand or type any questions into the chat. In person participants you are also able to use the Teams link to join the chat. 

Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and virtual. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, there are helpers in the room so raise your hand if you need assistance. There is also a dedicated helper for the virtual participants so please raise your virtual hand to attract their attention. In person participants you are welcome to post questions in the Teams chat, if you find this easier than putting your hand up. This will be saved and distributed at the end of the workshop.  

We would like to highlight that we have a [code of conduct](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-to-r/code.html) and by attending this workshop you are agreeing to abide by it. 

Let's get started.
