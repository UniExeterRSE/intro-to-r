# Executing an command in R

The console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where R is
waiting for you to tell it what to do, and where it will show the results of a
command that has been executed.  You can type commands directly into the console
and press `Enter` to execute those commands. For example we can use R as a calculator:

```{r echo=TRUE}
2+2 
```

# Interacting with R

There are two main ways of interacting with R: using the console or by using
script files (plain text files that contain your code). We want our code and workflow to be reproducible. In other words, we want to write code in a way that
anyone can easily replicate, such they can obtain the same results from our code
on their computer. If we type our commands irectly into the Console,  they will be forgotten when you close the session. It is better to enter the commands in the script editor, and save the script. This way, you have a complete record of what you did, you can easily show others how you did it and you can do it again later on if needed. 

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using
the <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd> shortcut. The command on the current
line in the script or all of the commands in the currently selected text will be
sent to the console and executed when you press <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> +
<kbd>`Enter`</kbd>.

At some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of variable or
the structure of an object, without necessarily keep a record of it in your
script. You can type these commands and execute them directly in the console.
RStudio provides the <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`1`</kbd> and <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> +
<kbd>`2`</kbd> shortcuts allow you to jump between the script and the console
windows.

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it
receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using
<kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>), R will try to execute it, and when
ready, show the results and come back with a new `>`-prompt to wait for new
commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn't complete yet,
the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you haven't finished entering
a complete command. This is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or
quotation, i.e. you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as
right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks. If
you're in RStudio and this happens, click inside the console window and press
`Esc`; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.
